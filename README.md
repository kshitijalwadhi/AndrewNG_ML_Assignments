# This repo contains the solutions to Andrew NG's course on Machine Learning. 
(Will be updated in accordance with progress in course)


## The problem statements are enclosed in .pdf format inside each directory.

The programs can be run easily inside Octave or MATLAB.

## Brief description of the problems and the results:

### EX-1

Implementing linear regression (both Univariate and Multivariate) using Gradient Descent as optimiser as well as verification using Normal Equation.
